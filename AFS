#This script will check to see if this storage account is accessible via TCP port 445, which is the port SMB uses. If port 445 is available, your Azure file share will be persistently mounted. Your organization or internet service provider (ISP) may block port 445
#You may use Azure Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN, Azure Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN, or ExpressRoute to tunnel SMB traffic to your Azure file share over a different port.
